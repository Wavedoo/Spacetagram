## About The Project
It is a project worked on for Shopify's Frontend Developer Intern Challenge. The goal of this project was to create an image-sharing platform similar to Instagram. This included having the ability to retrieve images and their related data from an API built by NASA, as well as the ability to like an unlike an image.

My version of the project uses NASA's Astronomy Photo Of the Day API. It uses jQuery to retrieve and display the results to the user in the webpage. Images are viewed in three different ways. The first one showing random images with an infinite scroll feature similiar to those found on many social media websites. The second one is searching for images between two appropriate dates. The final way to view images is the liked images section that show all previously liked images.
